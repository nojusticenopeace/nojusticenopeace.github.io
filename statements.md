San Jose mayor, Sam Liccardo in response to peaceful protests _[link](https://medium.com/@SamLiccardo/i-cant-breathe-17684b68309f)_
- Fatigued San Jose Police officers have been given the seemingly impossible task of ensuring safety for peaceful demonstrators, while identifying and arresting those few members of the crowd who seek to use destructive and violent means to injure our residents and officers, loot small business, and destroy our beloved San Jose.

Drew Brees
- In interview, he said:
> "I will never agree with anybody disrespecting the flag of the United States of America or our country. Let me just tell what I see or what I feel when the national anthem is played and when I look at the flag of the United States. I envision my two grandfathers, who fought for this country during World War II, one in the Army and one in the Marine Corp. Both risking their lives to protect our country and to try to make our country and this world a better place. So every time I stand with my hand over my heart looking at that flag and singing the national anthem, that’s what I think about ...
> "... And is everything right with our country right now? No, it is not. We still have a long way to go. But I think what you do by standing there and showing respect to the flag with your hand over your heart, is it shows unity. It shows that we are all in this together, we can all do better and that we are all part of the solution.”

San Jose councilmember, Lan Diep (district 4), publicly advocated for Jared Yuen, muted comments on his office's instagram when people were commenting about this. Lan Diep supports freedom of speech but "not the right to be heard the way I want to be heard." Instead of listening to "the overwhelming number of emails" he's received on #BLM and defunding the police, he's giving excuses for why it shouldn't happen.
