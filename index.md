## Quotes

> Saying "All Lives Matter" as a response to "Black Lives Matter" is like saying the fire department should spray down all the houses in a neighborhood even though only one house is on fire... because all houses matter. Yes, your house matters too, BUT YOUR HOUSE IS NOT ON FIRE???

Leslie Dwight:
> What if 2020 isn't cancelled? What if 2020 is the year we've been waiting for? A year so uncomfortable, so scary, ro raw - that it finally forces us to grow. A year that screams so loud finally waking us up from our slumber. 
> A year we finally accept the need for change. Declare change. Work for change. Become the change. A year we finally band together, instead of pushing each other further apart.
